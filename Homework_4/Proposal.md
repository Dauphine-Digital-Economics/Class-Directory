# Impact Market DAO proposal
  
 # Title: PACT Donation Matching Program and PACT Reward System to Encourage Donations
## Short description
**Overview:**
impactMarket is a platform that enables individuals and communities to contribute to social impact projects around the world. PACT is impactMarket's native token that is used to reward donors, support UBI communities, and incentivize investors. While impactMarket has seen tremendous growth and success, there is still an opportunity to increase the utility and value of the PACT token. This proposal focuses on incentivizing donors to increase their donations and use their PACT tokens in a way that benefits impactMarket and the communities it serves.

**Short description of the proposal:** This proposal aims to incentivize PACT donors to increase their donations by introducing ***(1) a donation matching program***. The program will match a portion of the donation made by the donor with PACT tokens, providing them with an opportunity to earn more PACT while supporting impactMarket's mission. At the same time, this proposal seeks to establish ***(2) a reward system for PACT token holders*** who donate to impactMarket, also encouraging increased donations and interaction with the DAO. By providing rewards and benefits to donors, we can create a sustainable and impactful community that supports impactMarket's mission.

## The scope - long description
  
### Background:
impactMarket is a Web3 platform dedicated to creating economic opportunities for underprivileged communities through the use of DeFi. The platform's goal is to leverage blockchain technology to provide access to financial services that would otherwise be unavailable to people living in poverty. 
 
It relies heavily on its community to support its initiatives. PACT token holders play a crucial role in the success of the DAO, as they are the backbone of its funding and growth. One of the primary ways that impactMarket raises funds for their projects is through donations. impactMarket uses a portion of these funds to purchase PACT tokens, which are then distributed to donors as a reward for their contributions. This incentivizes donors to continue supporting impactMarket's mission and also provides a tangible benefit for their support. 

To encourage PACT donors to increase their contributions, I propose the implementation of a **donation matching program**. In addition, there is currently no formal reward system in place for PACT token holders beyond receiving the tokens themselves. This proposal also seeks to address this by establishing a **reward system** that will encourage PACT holders to interact with the impactMarket DAO.

Donors play a crucial role in supporting impactMarket's mission. Through their contributions, they help fund social impact projects and provide critical support to UBI communities. However, many donors may not fully understand the potential impact of their donations or how they can use their PACT tokens to make a difference. This proposal aims to provide clear incentives and benefits to donors that encourage them to increase their donations and use their PACT tokens in a way that creates value for all stakeholders.

### Mechanism:
To incentivize donors to increase their donations and use their PACT tokens, the following mechanisms are proposed:

***1. Matching program.*** The donation matching program will match a portion of the donation made by the donor with PACT tokens. The exact matching rate will be determined by the DAO and can be adjusted periodically based on the availability of funds and the impact of the program. For example, if the matching rate is set at 50%, a donor who contributes 100 PACT will receive an additional 50 PACT as a reward.

***2. Reward system***, which will be a system with increasing rewards and benefits for higher levels of engagement.
  The proposed reward system will be structured as follows:
  
  - **Donations:** Donors who contribute a certain amount of funds to impactMarket will be rewarded with a set number of PACT tokens. The more they donate, the more tokens they will receive. This will incentivize donors to increase their contributions and also increase the amount of PACT tokens in circulation.
  - **Participation:** PACT token holders who actively participate in impactMarket's DAO will also be eligible for rewards. This can include activities such as voting on proposals, contributing to discussions, and volunteering time to help with impactMarket projects. The more active a PACT holder is within the DAO, the more rewards they will receive.
  - **Top leaders in the Leaders Board:** The board will track the impact of each donor's contributions. By showing donors how their donations are making a difference, it can also create a sense of competition and motivation that encourages them to contribute more.
  - **Referrals:** PACT holders who refer new donors to impactMarket will also be eligible for rewards. This will encourage PACT holders to spread the word about impactMarket's mission and increase the platform's reach.
  - **PACT Token Burn:** This could be a mechanism where donors can burn their PACT tokens to support social impact projects directly. By allowing donors to contribute their PACT tokens in this way, it can create a sense of ownership and engagement that encourages them to contribute more.
  - **UBI Community Engagement:** This will create opportunities for donors to engage directly with UBI communities and see the impact of their donations first-hand. By creating a sense of connection (could be considered rewarding) and empathy, it can motivate donors to increase their contributions and use their PACT tokens in a way that supports the needs of these communities.

### Metrics or Key Performance Indicators:
The success of the donation matching program will be measured by the following metrics:
  - Total amount of PACT donated during the program period;
  - Total amount of PACT matched through the program;
  - Number of unique donors who participated in the program;
  - Feedback and engagement from the impactMarket community.

Similarly, to measure the success of the proposed reward system, we can track the following metrics:
  - Total amount of donations received; 
  - Number of PACT tokens in circulation;
  - Number of active PACT holders within the DAO;
  - Number of referrals generated by PACT holders.
  
By tracking the total amount of donations received, we can gain insights into how effective the matching and reward systems are at incentivizing donations. This is simply tracking the total amount of donations received over a given period and compare it to previous periods. The number of active PACT holders within the DAO will help us understand how effective the reward system is at encouraging participation. The number of referrals generated by PACT holders will help to understand the impact of the reward system on increasing impactMarket's reach.

In addition, it is also possible to track the token velocity, which refers to the rate at which PACT tokens are being used and exchanged within the impactMarket community. By increasing token velocity, we can create a more vibrant and active ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. In a similar way, it would be an asset to track donor engagement, which would include the number of donors who participate in the rewards program, burn their PACT tokens, or engage with UBI communities. By understanding donor engagement, we can fine-tune the programs and ensure that they are meeting the needs and expectations of the donors.

### Financial Implications:
**The donation matching program** will require a budget allocation from impactMarket to fund the matching component of the program. The exact amount of funding required will depend on the matching. 

  First of all, the donation matching program can incentivize more PACT donations by offering a reward for contributions. This could lead to an increase in demand for PACT tokens, which could drive up the token's price in the market. As more people see the value in supporting impactMarket's mission, there could also be an increase in the number of PACT token holders, which would further increase demand. Moreover, the reward system can create a self-sustaining ecosystem where PACT holders are incentivized to actively participate in impactMarket's DAO, donate, and engage with UBI communities. This could lead to a loyal and engaged community, which could attract more investors and donors to support impactMarket's initiatives.

**The proposed reward system**, which includes donations, participation, top leaders in the leaderboard, referrals, PACT token burn, and UBI community engagement, can also have significant financial implications. It will require an initial investment to set up, but with the expectatoin that the increased donations and participation will offset these costs over time. Then there would be a need to allocate a portion of impactMarket's budget to fund the rewards program, but I believe that the benefits of increased engagement and participation will far outweigh the costs. By providing incentives for donations and engagement, more funds can be raised for social impact projects and UBI communities, which can lead to more economic opportunities and financial inclusion. 
  
  In addition, by tracking the impact of each donor's contributions and creating a sense of competition among donors, there could be a positive effect on the platform's growth and popularity. If more people are aware of impactMarket and its mission, it could lead to more investors and donors joining the platform, resulting in a significant increase in the demand for PACT tokens. The proposed PACT token burn mechanism can also have a positive impact on the platform's finances. By allowing donors to contribute their PACT tokens directly to social impact projects, it could create a sense of ownership and engagement that encourages them to contribute more. The burning of PACT tokens could reduce the circulating supply, creating scarcity, and potentially driving up the price of the token.

 ### Concluding remarks

**Overall,** present proposal to introduce a donation matching program and reward system for PACT token holders is a step towards creating a sustainable and impactful community that supports impactMarket's mission. This proposal aims to incentivize PACT donors to increase their donations and use their PACT tokens in a way that benefits both impactMarket and the communities it serves. For impactMarket, the program will increase the funding available to support its initiatives, while also creating a sense of community and engagement among its members. For PACT donors, the program provides an opportunity to earn more PACT while supporting a cause they believe in. The mechanisms related to the donation matching program and reward system will provide clear incentives and benefits that encourage donors to increase their contributions and create a sense of connection with UBI communities. The reward system will incentivize donors to contribute more funds to impactMarket, encourage active participation in the DAO, and increase the platform's reach through referrals. By establishing a formal reward system for PACT token holders, impactMarket can increase engagement with its community and further its mission to provide economic opportunities to underprivileged communities through DeFi. I believe this proposal provides a unique and impactful way for individuals and communities to contribute to social impact projects around the world.
