## Title: Creating a PACT Reward System to Encourage Donations

Short description: This proposal seeks to establish a reward system for PACT token holders who donate to impactMarket, encouraging increased donations and interaction with the DAO.

### The scope

#### Background:
impactMarket is a Web3 platform dedicated to creating economic opportunities for underprivileged communities through the use of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform's goal is to leverage blockchain technology to provide access to financial services that would otherwise be unavailable to people living in poverty.

One of the primary ways that impactMarket raises funds for their projects is through donations. impactMarket uses a portion of these funds to purchase PACT tokens, which are then distributed to donors as a reward for their contributions. This incentivizes donors to continue supporting impactMarket's mission and also provides a tangible benefit for their support.

However, there is currently no formal reward system in place for PACT token holders beyond receiving the tokens themselves. This proposal seeks to address this by establishing a reward system that will encourage PACT holders to interact with the impactMarket DAO.

#### Proposal:
The proposed reward system will be structured as follows:

Donations: Donors who contribute a certain amount of funds to impactMarket will be rewarded with a set number of PACT tokens. The more they donate, the more tokens they will receive. This will incentivize donors to increase their contributions and also increase the amount of PACT tokens in circulation.

Participation: PACT token holders who actively participate in impactMarket's DAO will also be eligible for rewards. This can include activities such as voting on proposals, contributing to discussions, and volunteering time to help with impactMarket projects. The more active a PACT holder is within the DAO, the more rewards they will receive.

Referrals: PACT holders who refer new donors to impactMarket will also be eligible for rewards. This will encourage PACT holders to spread the word about impactMarket's mission and increase the platform's reach.

#### Metrics or Key Performance Indicators:

To measure the success of the proposed reward system, we will track the following metrics:

Total amount of donations received: This will give us a clear picture of how effective the reward system is at incentivizing donations.
Number of PACT tokens in circulation: This will help us understand the impact of the reward system on the supply of PACT tokens.
Number of active PACT holders within the DAO: This will help us understand how effective the reward system is at encouraging participation.
Number of referrals generated by PACT holders: This will help us understand the impact of the reward system on increasing impactMarket's reach.
Financial Implications:

The proposed reward system will require an initial investment to set up, but we expect that the increased donations and participation will offset these costs over time. We will need to allocate a portion of impactMarket's budget to fund the rewards program, but we believe that the benefits of increased engagement and participation will far outweigh the costs.

Conclusion:

The proposed PACT reward system will incentivize donors to contribute more funds to impactMarket, encourage active participation in the DAO, and increase the platform's reach through referrals. By establishing a formal reward system for PACT token holders, impactMarket can increase engagement with its community and further its mission to provide economic opportunities to underprivileged communities through DeFi.
